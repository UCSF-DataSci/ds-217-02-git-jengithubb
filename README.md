My name is Jennifer Zhu, and I’m a first-year student in the Health Data Science program. I’m here to gain more knowledge about data science and develop a strong understanding of how Python is applied in the industry. I hope to become fluent in using Python as a tool for data management and visualization. Additionally, I’m eager to learn key data science concepts and explore basic machine learning techniques.
