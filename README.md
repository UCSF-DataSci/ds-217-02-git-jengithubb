### Create a Python script that prints "Hello, Data Science!"
Created a python file that prints "Hello, Data Science!" in the scripts folder.

### If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get (3, 5, 6, 9). The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
The sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is 233168.
#### script
```
sum = 0
for i in range(1000):
    if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
        sum += i
print(sum)
```

### Brief introduction 
My name is Jennifer Zhu, and I’m a first-year student in the Health Data Science program. I’m here to gain more knowledge about data science and develop a strong understanding of how Python is applied in the industry. I hope to become fluent in using Python as a tool for data management and visualization. Additionally, I’m eager to learn key data science concepts and explore basic machine learning techniques.
